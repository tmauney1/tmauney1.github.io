This is a marketing/promotional site for The Beard's Watch Podcast.  I developed and designed this site from scratch, and was the lead developer for this project.  The site was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Its goal is to promote the podcast, increase podcast views, and increase purchase of merchandise. The site provides information about the podcast, serves as a landing page for accessing current episodes, upcoming events, and purchasing merchandise.  I have been in charge of updating the site, managing content, and performing maintenance on this site for the past three years.
